This code is intended as a framework of ethics for creators to foster a healthy long-term relationship and trust with collectors. It is not intended to be enforced by anyone or used in any binding capacity.

* I will not mint anyone else’s work without their prior knowledge and agreement.

* If an artwork results from cooperation, I will give credit where credit is due.

* Unless explicitly stated beforehand, I will not mint the same work on different chains or platforms.

* I will not re-mint any of my work unless it is in a transformative way.

* If an NFT is part of a series of similar works, I will declare this from the first minted work.

* I will not mint any work that infringes on the personal rights of other individuals (Parody and satire isn’t regarded as an infringement of personal rights.)

* If possible, I will contact the author of a work that I wish to create a derivative work of.

* I will not try to misrepresent the identity of the author of the work or the identity of the work that I mint.

* I may sell physical editions with the same content as my NFTs unless I specifically tie a physical edition to a tokenized one and vice versa.

* I will be transparent about any future potential technical issues with the preservation and longevity of my NFT to the best of my knowledge.
