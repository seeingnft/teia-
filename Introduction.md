**Hint:** Before you start minting, you can already start setting up your profile if you already have a wallet. Read [How to set up your profile](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui/wiki/Edit-your-profile)

**Hint:** In order for your Objekts to show up on the default feed on teia, you either have to have setup a profile, or hold some hDAO, or ideally, both. Read about [hDAO](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui/wiki/hDAO)
