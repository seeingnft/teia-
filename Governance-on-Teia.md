"We believe in shared ownership on the platform, no one should have exclusive rights over others"

_(from the Teia Core Values Manifesto)_

***

The fundamental principles that shape the community are the same as those for its governance: Inclusivity, Respect, Community/Solidarity, Decentralization, Simplicity, Accessibility, Sustainability and Creativity.

The process of forming a real DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) will take a long time and we want to be able to vote on pressing decisions transparently and on-chain. We believe that, together, we can create tools, applications and processes respecting the community’s needs and wishes. we are all building the future of the TEIA ecosystem together.


## Dao as a Goal

_“Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance is coordinated using tokens or NFTs that grant voting powers. Admission to a DAO is limited to people who have a confirmed ownership of these governance tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet, and membership may be exchanged. Governance is conducted through a series of proposals that members vote on through the blockchain, and the possession of more governance tokens often translates to greater voting power. Contributions from members towards the organizational goals of a DAO can sometimes be tracked and internally compensated.”_

_(From Wikipedia, DAO Governance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)_

It is the goal of the Teia Community to form a DAO with governance through voting Tokens. 
Teia's DAO is under construction, a process in which the whole community is invited to participate. We anticipate a long development phase in order to respect the main points of the Manifesto, such as recognizing diversity and facilitating inclusion. We anticipate that once created, the Teia DAO will continue to morph and improve, in order to respect the evolution of the platform and all of the communities to be represented.
The decision-making process of TEIA is horizontal and will take into account the needs and policies decided by all the groups represented. These groups will also have some economic autonomy in decision-making. 

we started developing a prototype DAO token and smart contract for the TEIA DAO. The code is currently in development
see this [discord discussion on the first Teia DAo Token prototype](https://discord.com/channels/908672304236625970/946909003185791037/951597375317737473)and find the 
[Teia DAO prototype on Github](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-smart-contracts/blob/main/python/contracts/daoToken.py)


### Tokenomics
There is a [working doc on the tokenomics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19e-UrTX5ME5ZUVpyc7ZunrTckJgei5UQsCeCHfB0nnk/edit#) and a [discourse thread](https://discourse.hencommunity.quest/t/the-hic-et-nunc-dao-implementation-discussion/286/21), the model will need to be adjusted along the [legal discusion](https://discourse.hencommunity.quest/t/discussion-writeup-the-legal-roadmap-for-teia-next-steps/597/1)

Currently there seems to be a consensus towards quadratic voting and some kind of option to swap hDAO for the new Tea DAO Token.

### Equity

Our mission to reach true decentralization and equity includes a community-decided allotment to guarantee marginalized communities are 
included in governance. We understand that now is the time to take a novel, genuine approach 
to equitable governance and acknowledging the needs of our most underrepresented communities 
in a concrete way. Leaders within these groups are being nominated by the community and will 
be included in the weaving of the new Teia DAO.


## ORG-Structure

for the structure of the Org there are two proposals that seem to be good corner stones reflecting what structure we want to build towards:

### babycommandos Guild proposal
We are also planning on implementing Multisig contracts for multiple Guilds (=Working Groups) that will enable a voting mechanism on decisions that are better decided by the people working on certain parts of the project in order to make decisionmaking more flexible and faster. [find babycommandos Guild proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Or12QOKJ-xdO_Lkz33-86aVHyuz5lmheLhMwXgpEI0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Governance before a DAO is formed

Until the DAO is formally created, a multisig wallet with ~15 rotating people has control of the platform’s funds (with a quorum required to complete transactions). This group is not in place to form decisions, but exists to implement the will of the community.

Take a look at the Multisig here:
https://multisign.onrender.com/

The intermediate ways how consesnus is formed are via discussions with soft consensus, discord polls for small decisions and for bigger decisions we use on-chain voting via the [Teia Vote Tool](https://vote.hencommunity.quest/), where everybody with a TEIA account (wallet) created before a set date has the right to vote. Votes cast on the website are recorded on the blockchain, and a script tallies and displays the votes on the website after the voting period ends. These results can be independently verified by the voters using the unchangeable blockchain data. 

Currently, all major proposals and questions are discussed at the [Teia Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bXyTPRx2) and the [Community Discourse Forum](https://discourse.hencommunity.quest/) before being put up for a vote. Whoever wants to submit a proposal can access the TEIA Discord Channel where the proposal will be discussed by the entire community and taken to vote.
