## Currently: 0% fee 

Currently new swaps on Teia are carrying a 0% for the first phase of the Launch.
This will soon change and we plan to setting the Marketplace fee to something around 2.5% to cover the maintance costs.
For now, we rely on donations to fund the operations.

## infra cost donations

The estimated expense to keep the platform running is $1,350USD per month, and about $1,650USD remaining for one off expenses plus some expected amounts for legal and registration costs.

To find out more about the expected monthly and one time expenses that will help to keep Teia operational, take a look at the [Teia Notion finances](https://www.notion.so/Finances-c15bd7bcf7ec4a67af13d7e162dc39bb) section. Currently there are no allocations for wages for any Teia community individuals, at this stage everyone is volunteering their time and energy.

To cover the infra costs (indexer, server etc) that are run by manitcor/teztools we ask the community for donations into the following wallet:

## In the future: marketplace fees

In the future Swaps that carry value will be charged a fee which goes towards platform maintenance and web3 developments. The fee is paid by the buyer and deducted from the list price. You should factor this in when setting your prices. Free OBJKTs do not incur a maintenance fee.

For example, if fees are set to 2.5% if the price of an OBJKT is 10 tez, and royalties are 10%, then at the point of the swap, 0.25 tez is paid to the platform in fees, 1 tez is paid to the creator in royalties, and 8.75 tez is paid to the seller of the OBJKT.




The fees are calculated automatically by the [Teia Community Marketplace](https://tzkt.io/KT1PHubm9HtyQEJ4BBpMTVomq6mhbfNZ9z5w/operations/) smart contract ([read the source code](https://github.com/teia-community/objkt-swap/blob/master/smart-py/marketplace.py)) and paid out to the [Teia Community multisig](https://tzkt.io/KT1PKBTVmdxfgkFvSeNUQacYiEFsPBw16B4P/operations/) wallet.
