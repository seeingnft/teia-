### **mint**

1: _(verb)_ to create an OBJKT (NFT)
***

## Important Rules and considerations

If you mint NFTs on Teia we expect you to respect the [Core Values](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Core-Values-Code-of-Conduct-Terms-and-Conditions) and especially note the detail on [copyminting](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Core-Values-Code-of-Conduct-Terms-and-Conditions#about-copyminting). (Copyminting is the act of taking another's work and minting it as your own, and your account will be restricted if you do this. It includes the act of minting the same work twice, either on the same or separate platforms.)

**Please note that minting the same media file twice leads to an account restriction! if you made a mistake and want to re-mint your OBJKT, make sure to burn the old one first!** [(How to burn)](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/How-to-burn-%F0%9F%94%A5)

## Step by step guide


1. You should have already created a wallet (we recommend [Temple](https://templewallet.com/) or [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/)). Click on ‚ÄúSync". Your browser will show a pop-up asking you to sync with your wallet.

2. Approve the sync with your wallet.
3. Click the "OBJKT (mint)" button in the hamburger drop-down menu.
6. Fill out the information for your OBJKT. The number of editions is final; you can't add. Title, descriptions, tags, and royalties are also final. You can input the price of the OBJKT after the minting. You can upload display images/gifs depending on the media type. **The file size limit is currently 100MB**. 
7. Click on Preview to see a preview of the mint. Double-check that the information for the mint is correct. If there is a mistake, click on the "back" link to change the information.
8. Click on "mint OBJKT". You will be prompted to approve the transaction in your wallet app.
9. Check in your wallet if the minting was confirmed. Times vary for how long the confirmation should take, but it usually takes a couple of minutes.
10. Based on the number of editions you minted, you will see the new ‚ÄúOBJKTS‚Äù in your tezos wallet. These newly minted OBJKTs now belong to you.

**Important:** _At this point your OBJKT doesn‚Äôt have a price on it._
