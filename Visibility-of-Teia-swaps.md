## Background

On March 20th Teia switched from hicetnuncs v2 marketplace contract to Teias own marketplace contract.
This means, [marketplace fees](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Marketplace-Fees) collected with these swaps are now going to the Teia community Multisig Wallet, that is controlled by about 15 rotating members of the Teia community, and can be spent on Teias voted on budget. new swaps on teia executed after the contract went live are automatically swapped onto the teia marketplace contract, old swaps need to be reswapped in order to be on the teia swapping contract.

The hicetnunc v2 marketplace contract directs the platform fees of objkts traded through it to crzypatchwork. from crzypatchworks [discord statements it looks like he doesnt plan for hicetnunc.xyz to support other marketplace contracts than v2.](https://discord.com/channels/759930487946215444/818200709929238559/933199618018275418), teia.art will keep on supporting the hicetnunc v2 swapping contract for now so that the users don’t have to reswap everything to be listed on teia but new swaps on teia will be created onto the new teia smartcontract.

>Teia will keep on using hicetnuncs OBJKT minting contract for the time being. that means the OBJKTs minted on teia will show up on all marketplaces that show hicetnunc OBJKTs (i.e. hicetnunc.xyz, objktcom, rarible, hic.af, etc) this won't change no matter which platform supports which swapping contract. This article is only about which “listings/swapps” will appear on which site.

## why does my swap (=listing price) not show up on hicetnunc/objkt.com/...?

In order for those swaps to appear on other marketplaces like objkt.com, hicetnunc, hic.af, those marketplace need to support and index the Teia  swaps. This means the marketplaces need to change their indexers and adjust their UI a bit and is up to the marketplace owner(s) to decide which swaps they want to index.

>if a marketplace X supports the swapping contract of marketplace Y, it means that OBJKTs swapped for trade on the marketplace Y contract will be also tradeable on marketplace X and even though the token got traded on marketplace X the fees will go to marketplace Y (if bought through the Y contract)

for example: currently objktcom support hicetnuncs v2 marketplace contract but the hicetnunc.xyz marketplace does not support objktcoms swapping contract, meaning: swaps from hicetnunc show up and are tradeable at objktcom but hicetnunc OBJKTs swapped on objktcom can’t be traded on hicetnunc.xyz.

The Teia community is currently in touch with other marketplaces that list OBJKT tokens. The general idea is to mutually show swaps from other marketplaces. The OBJKT pages at Teia could become a place where collectors can find all the listing prices from different marketplaces and compare all the available listing prices. We are currently in the process of negotiating with other marketplaces and putting the options we have to a vote.
