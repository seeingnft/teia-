# Ukraine Fundraiser

In support for our Ukrainian friends, brothers and sisters, [Veqtor](https://twitter.com/Veqtor/status/1497167740146266112?s=20&t=mmvu8KPxybOa0TQXX32nFw) from [Versum](https://twitter.com/versumofficial) and [FxHash](https://twitter.com/fx_hash_/status/1497113572085751810?s=20&t=mmvu8KPxybOa0TQXX32nFw) set up a shared donation contract that will redirect tezos to multiple charity orgs (listed below) in support of Ukraine relief, and we want to help support this initiative.


If you wish to donate, send tezos (no direct NFT donations please, only tezos) or set up a collab contract on [teia.art](https://teia.art/) to direct % of the fees to this fundraiser address (see how to below):
