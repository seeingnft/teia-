In support for our Ukrainian friends, brothers and sisters, Versum and [FxHash](https://twitter.com/fx_hash_/status/1497113572085751810?s=20&t=mmvu8KPxybOa0TQXX32nFw) set up a shared donation contract that will redirect tezos to multiple charity orgs (listed below) in support of Ukraine relief, and we want to help support this initiative.
