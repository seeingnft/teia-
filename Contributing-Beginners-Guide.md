# How to Contribute to Teia? (Beginners Guide)
You can contribute to Teia in the following ways: 
* Fix bugs
* Code development
* Maintain documents
* Translate documents

You will need to have basic Git skills and have a GitHub account.

Here are the steps to contribute:
- Create a fork of [https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui)
- Create a feature/fix branch on the fork using the following fork naming convention: `<feature-or-fix>/<feature-name-or-issue-id>`
- Implement the feature/fix
- Create a pull request to teia-ui
- Verify the [automated build](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui/actions) succeeded

If all goes well, your pull request is merged. Keep your pull request as small as possible so it's easier to add it to the main repository. For questions, reach the dev team in the #general-dev channel of the [Teia Discord](https://discord.gg/QckkbVMcWu).
