## I received some tez, so I suppose I sold work. But where do I see which OBJKT I sold?

First of all, congratulations. You can use the following to track your recent sales: https://hicdex.com/sold

## How do I get a notification when something sells?
You can use the telegram notification bot or Cryptonoises bot that we have listed in the [Tools/Selling Tools](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Tools-made-by-the-community#selling-tools) section

## Where can I see overall statistics for the site?
https://hicdex.com/charts

## I want to create my own gallery. How do I do it?
This is currently being developed. We are not taking any pull requests at the moment to have a gallery featured but you will be able to make your own in the future. Meanwhile have a look at the various tools [Tools/Gallery Tools](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Tools-made-by-the-community#gallery-tools), some might need coding knowledge.

## What video formats/codecs are supported?
We recommend mp4, although you can mint webm, mov, and ogv. H.265 codec is not supported, we recommend H.264.

## Are there any file-size limits for objkts I mint?
Yes, currently (March 2022) the file size limit is 100MB. Some have noted problems uploading files above 80MB but this is not confirmed.

## I have an idea for a new feature or an improvement! Where can I submit it?
The official way to submit features to the developers is on the [github issues](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-ui/issues). There is also the #feature-requests channel in the [Teia Discord](https://discord.gg/94mdtxcY).

## How do I add my name and avatar to my profile?
Please see [Editing your profile](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Edit-your-profile)

## Can I sell my OBJKTs on Opensea/Rarible?
Opensea - no. Rarible - yes. Opensea announced in February 2021 that they will be working with Tezos. They haven't announced any news since then. We can only hope this will be an option in the future.

## Why is my OBJKT not showing up on the latest feed?
You need to have registered/updated a profile and/or hold some hDAO tokens to be shown on the feed. How much hDAO you need is relative to how much your mint and the current market price. If you have an updated profile you may mint ~7 OBJKTs per week window, beyond that you will need the minimum of (0.5tez, $1 or 0.1hDAO), in hDAO, per OBJKT, beyond your 7 free ones, furthermore, if you mint a lot in a 3-hour span, that threshold is fed through an exponential within that 3-hour window.
You may acquire hDAO through tips or by purchasing it via swap markets like [Quipuswap](https://quipuswap.com/swap).
This was implemented to combat copyminters and shouldn't affect regular users.

## How to avoid copyminters
We take fraud and theft of artwork very seriously. A team works to remove inauthentic work and artists from the platform.
Ideally, verify every account you collect from. First, have they added artist information in the objkt description (check that it looks genuine)? Next, click on the artist name and check the profile of the account. Have they named the profile or is it just a tez wallet? Have they added profile verification in the form of twitter, web, discord, tzprofile etc? If they have none of these, you can check the wallet by clicking on it on their profile page directly by clicking on it on their profile page. It takes you to the tzkt block explorer. Check how old the account is. Warning signs - an account that is very new (< 2 days) esp if it has many objkts; no profile information; no verification information; brand new twitter account.

Unfortunately, there are people minting NFTs who did not create what they upload. These copyminters, as we call them, try to make a quick buck with art from other people. Collectors have to be very careful and use their own judgement to find out who the artists are and if the art is genuine.
Be aware that devious copyminters attempt to fool collectors by using very similar artist-names especially of big-selling artists or prior to popular notified drops (eg adding an extra letter or even just a fullstop at the end of the name). 
If the work seems very professional, has obvious signs of artistic effort and the price is very low with no artist information at all, be very careful - if you collect a work that is later found to be copyminted, it gets tagged as restricted and is essentially valueless. We recommend that you burn such objkts.

*Artists - to make it easier for collectors, please verify your profile (see above). Leave a link to any social profile or website in the description of your artwork, so potential buyers can validate the authenticity. 

## I want to report a copyminter
Currently all copyminter operations occur on the hicetnunc discord.
The fastest way to report a copyminter is to note the details, including the wallet address in [hicetnuncs discord](https://discord.gg/Yx6UN5SkCd) in the #report-copyminters channel.

## How can I promote my NFT or my NFT exhibition?
On the Teia Discord please only use the channel #shill for self-promotion. If you shill in other channels a big black cloud will descend on you (and your post will be deleted, possibly with unsmiling emojis).

## Do you support multiple languages?
We are working on multiple language support on Teia. we also try to translate as many documents as possible to keep everything accessible. But currently teia.art is only available in English.
