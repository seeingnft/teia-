1: _(verb)_ to "delete" your OBJKT

Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, so you can't "delete" them. The "burn" button sends the OBJKT to the [burn address](https://tzkt.io/tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX/operations/), or you can send it yourself using your wallet app. The burn address is an open address that nobody owns a key to.

To burn an OBJKT:
1. Make sure your wallet app is synced with Teia.
2. Make sure you cancel the swap of the OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it.

3. Press the burn button. Your wallet app will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Once the transaction completes, your wallet app will show the OBJKT as transferred to the burn address.
4. You can also send the OBJKT to a burn address directly from your Tezos wallet. The address is: `tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX`. 

**Note:** _If someone buys one of your editions, even if you burn the rest of them, the OBJKT won't disappear from your profile_
